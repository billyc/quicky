# Quicky Transit Help and FAQ

Quicky provides real-time transit maps and GPS-based bus & train arrival info for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. The "killer feature" that I wanted—but that no app seemed to have when I started this—was the ability to set an alarm when my bus or train was a few minutes away, and to be able to snooze the alarm if I wasn't quite ready to leave yet. From that humble beginning, this app has sprung.

Quicky is **free** with **no ads** and I don't make any money from it aside from the cute little tip jar in the app settings. So please don't expect a level of support you'd get from a real app developer. But that being said, I hope you like Quicky and find it useful.

-------

## Basic Usage

Swipe from the left side of the screen to see the three main sections of Quicky: arrival times, maps, and alarms. You can also get to help and settings from there.

### Nearby and Favorite Stops

**Location**. Quicky uses your phone's location/GPS to find the closest stops to your current position. It groups all the routes that serve a stop onto a single card. You can tap on a stop name to "expand" the stop and see its arrivals.

**Inbound/Outbound**. Most transit routes go in two directions, often "inbound" and "outbound". Quicky tries its best to put inbound services on the left and outbound services on the right. Some cities like Los Angeles just use East/West and North/South instead, and Quicky follows suit.

**Asterisks.** An asterisk means a prediction is based on the transit *schedule*, not GPS. A prediction with an asterisk is probably less accurate than GPS-based predictions.

**Maps**. You can tap on any route icon to pull up a live map of that route, its stops, and live vehicle locations.

**Alarms**. You can tap on the destination or predictions on a stop card to set an alarm for that stop. Alarms can be used to notify you when a bus or train is a few minutes from arriving.

**Auto-refresh**. Quicky never shows stale predictions. Every card is auto-refreshed with live data constantly; you don't need to refresh manually.

**Hide Routes**. There might be a bunch of routes that you don't ever use which serve a stop. On the Favorites page (only), you can tap the "more" dropdown on the stop card to hide and unhide routes you don't care about.

### Lookup Page

You can access the raw transit data directly on the Lookup Page. Here you can drill down into the specific route/stop/direction and see arrivals for a particular stop. This can be useful if the nearby or favorites pages don't seem to be showing a stop that you think has service. That can happen if Quicky's stop database gets out of date, which is rare but does happen.

### Route Maps

You can see route maps by swiping from the left of the screen to get to the Maps page, or by tapping on any route icon on the Nearby and Favorites pages. Route maps show all the stops and vehicles serving that line. You can tap the stops to see arrivals and to switch to other routes serving that stop.

### Alarms

*Alarms are not guaranteed to work every time; I do my best but their accuracy really depends heavily on the quality of the predictions that Quicky receives from the transit operator. I hope you find it useful even though I can't make it bullet-proof.*

Tap any arrival predictions to set an alarm for that route. Alarms can be set for multiple routes serving a stop, but currently only one stop at a time can have an active alarm.

You can pick which routes to track, in which direction, and how far in the future you want to be notified.

Access the list of alarms you've set previously by swiping from the left and checking out the ugly Saved Alarms page. Someday I'll clean that page up. Sorry.

### Settings

You can fiddle with alarm and location settings here. If you have weird problems with route predictions, you can also try resetting the route database here.

## FAQ

### What are the asterisks?

An *asterisk next to an arrival time means that the time is based on the transit **schedule**, instead of using satellite-based GPS positioning. Some transit systems are better than others at keeping to their schedules; this arrival time is likely less accurate than the arrivals that are based on GPS.

### Why is it called Quicky?

Because funny. And, well, back when I lived in San Francisco I originally called the app QuickMuni as a joke since everyone in SF knows that Muni buses are anything but quick. Now that it works in more than one city, I wanted to rename it to evoke QuickMuni but not be specific to Muni. Behold! Quicky.

### Beta Testing

Want to help test Quicky? You can be on the bleeding edge by [following this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.worldofbilly.quickmuni) and agreeing to join the beta program. Quicky will then automatically update to the latest beta versions when they come out.
