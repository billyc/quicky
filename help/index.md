### Quicky Transit Help

Quicky is a little app I whipped up that provides real-time transit maps and GPS-based bus & train arrival info for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. The ""killer feature" that I wanted—but that no app seemed to have when I started this—was the ability to set an alarm when my bus or train was a few minutes away, and to be able to snooze the alarm if I wasn't quite ready to leave yet. From that humble beginning, this app has sprung.

Quicky is **free** with **no ads** and I don't make any money from it aside from the cute little "tip jar" in the app settings. So please don't expect a level of support you'd get from a real app developer. But that being said, I hope you like Quicky and find it useful.

#### Why is it called Quicky?

Because funny. And, well, back when I lived in San Francisco I originally called the app QuickMuni as a joke since everyone in SF knows that Muni buses are anything but quick. Now that it works in more than one city, I wanted to rename it to evoke QuickMuni but not be specific to Muni. Behold! Quicky.
