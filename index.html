<p>This little side project of mine has grown a bit! Quicky now provides real-time transit arrival information for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. The "killer feature" that I wanted but that no app seemed to have when I started, was the ability to set an alarm when my bus or train was a few minutes away, and to be able to snooze the alarm. From that humble beginning, this app has sprung.</p>

<p>Quicky is <strong>free</strong> with <strong>no ads</strong> and I don't make any money from it aside from the cute little "tip jar" hidden in the app settings. So please don't expect a level of support you'd get from a real app developer. But that being said, I hope you like Quicky and find it useful.</p>

<p>Because funny. And, well, back when I lived in San Francisco I originally called the app QuickMuni as a joke since everyone in SF knows that Muni buses are anything but quick. Now that it works in more than one city, I wanted to rename it to evoke QuickMuni but not be specific to Muni. Behold! Quicky.</p>
