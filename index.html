</h3>

<p>
Quicky is a little app I whipped up that provides real-time transit maps and GPS-based bus &amp; train arrival info for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. The "killer feature" that I wanted—but that no app seemed to have when I started this—was the ability to set an alarm when my bus or train was a few minutes away, and to be able to snooze the alarm if I wasn't quite ready to leave yet. From that humble beginning, this app has sprung.
</p>

<p>Quicky is <strong>free</strong> with <strong>no ads</strong> and I don't make any money from it aside from the cute little "tip jar" hidden in the app settings. So please don't expect a level of support you'd get from a real app developer. But that being said, I hope you like Quicky and find it useful.</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p><b>Real-time arrivals.</b> Quicky fetches real-time arrival predictions straight from your transit agency. It will show you how many minutes away the next few arrivals are, for every destination served by a stop. If there is scheduled service but no actual real-time data for a bus, the arrival time will have an asterisk* to let you know it may not be accurate.</p>

<p><b>Alarms.</b> Set an alarm and be notified when your bus or train is 3, 5, 10 minutes away. And if you need more time to finish your cocktail or tie your shoes, you can "snooze" until the next arrival, too.</p>

<p><b>Maps.</b> Tap on any route number to see a map of the route, its stops, and live GPS-based vehicle locations. Note it takes a few moments for the GPS data to percolate through the transit agency system, so your bus is probably further along than it may appear. It's still great for verifying that a route is actually running and that predictions are "live".</p>

<p><b>Favorites.</b> Pick your favorite stops and the list will always show the closest stop to you and all the arrivals coming and going at that stop. If your stop is served by some bus routes that you just don't care about, you can hide those so they're not bugging you.</p>

<a id="why-is-it-called-quicky" class="anchor" href="#why-is-it-called-quicky" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is it called Quicky?</h3>

<p>Because funny. And, well, back when I lived in San Francisco I originally called the app QuickMuni as a joke since everyone in SF knows that Muni buses are anything but quick. Now that it works in more than one city, I wanted to rename it to evoke QuickMuni but not be specific to Muni. Behold! Quicky.</p>

<p>Thanks a million to Luis Tobar for the pitch-perfect Spanish translation, and to Aaron Clark for the gentle nudge at Honcho that got me to add Pittsburgh.</p>
