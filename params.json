{"name":"Quicky Transit","tagline":"Real-time bus & train arrivals for Android: San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh","body":"### You've found Quicky Transit!\r\n\r\nThis little side project of mine has grown a bit! Quicky now provides real-time transit arrival information for San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. The \"killer feature\" that I wanted but that no app seemed to have when I started, was the ability to set an alarm when my bus or train was a few minutes away, and to be able to snooze the alarm. From that humble beginning, this app has sprung.\r\n\r\nQuicky is **free** with **no ads** and I don't make any money from it aside from the cute little \"tip jar\" hidden in the app settings. So please don't expect a level of support you'd get from a real app developer. But that being said, I hope you like Quicky and find it useful.\r\n\r\n#### Beta Testing\r\n\r\nWant to help test Quicky? If you want to be a beta tester, email me at quicky@worldofbilly.com and I'll send you an email on how to get started.\r\n\r\n#### Why is it called Quicky?\r\n\r\nBecause funny. And, well, back when I lived in San Francisco I originally called the app QuickMuni as a joke since everyone in SF knows that Muni buses are anything but quick. Now that it works in more than one city, I wanted to rename it to evoke QuickMuni but not be specific to Muni. Behold! Quicky.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
